# UserForms Conversion

A simple Silverstripe addon which provides a "Conversion Tracking Code" CMS field for all UserForm pages. Any code snippet added to this field is added into the forms "success" page. 

This makes it easy to add goal/conversion tracking codes from your analytics provider to track UserForms submissions.

## Usage

Install via composer `composer require purplespider/userforms-conversion`

Dev/build

Find the "Conversion Tracking Code" field at the bottom of the "Configuration" tab for any UserForm page.
